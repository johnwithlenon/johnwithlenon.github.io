# About PmxEditor English version
{: .fs-9 }

PmxEditor English version is an un-official translated version of the original PmxEditor version. The original version is in Japanese language, and it's really hard to use worldwide. That's why I translated it.

That mean I'm NOT the author of PmxEditor. The original author is KyokuhokuP (極北P). I only translate it from Japanese to English.<br />
(But actually I didn't translate much, because Inochi-PM did almost the job)
